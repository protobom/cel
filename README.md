# Protobom CEL Integration

This repository houses the protobom CEL integration. This is a go module that
can be embedded in other programs that wish to let users query and recompose
SBOM data based on the [Common Expression Language](https://cel.dev/) (CEL).

This project provides the functions and data types to expose the protobom graph
API to the CEL evaluator. 

⚠️ Under Construction ⚠️

Please excuse the dust while we move the module into the protobom project. 
While this code is reasonably mature, please expect things to move around a
lot before we cut the first release. Especially since we're refactoring it 
to be a general purpose go module. 

Also: Contributions are welcome starting now!

## Documentation

We have some [documentation](docs) and [examples](examples), we'll expand them
as soon as we've moved in.

## History

This project was originally funded by the 
[DHS Science and Technology](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology) directorate.
